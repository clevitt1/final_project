# final_project

#Please see the Completed Project folder for all of our work. Our app is located in the app folder; however, if plotly gives you trouble, there is a non-plotly markdown  version of the app in the Supporting Code folder. To run the non-plotly version, set the Raw Data folder to be your wd, and then run the first chunk of the non-plotly file to do the wrangling.
